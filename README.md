# Incident Response Simulation Lab

A collection of detailed incident analyses performed using the **5 W's framework** (Who, What, When, Where, Why) to practice and demonstrate skills in digital forensics and incident response (DFIR).

## Case Studies

### 1. Healthcare Ransomware Attack
- **Date Simulated:** April 2025
- **Summary:** Analyzed a ransomware attack initiated through a phishing email, resulting in the encryption of critical patient data.
- **Key Findings:** Identified the attack vector, motive (financial), and impact. Outlined containment and recovery procedures.

### 2. Malware Infection via Email
- **Date Simulated:** May 2025
- **Summary:** Investigated a malware incident delivered via a password-protected spreadsheet attachment.
- **Key Findings:** Mapped the attack chain, highlighted the use of IDS for detection, and identified lack of user awareness as a root cause.

### 3. E-Commerce Data Breach
- **Date Simulated:** May 2025
- **Summary:** Analyzed a data breach caused by exploiting a vulnerability in a web application, leading to the theft of PII and financial records.
- **Key Findings:** Focused on vulnerability management and the importance of patching. Detailed the exfiltration of sensitive data.
